# Jason CLI

Jason is a general purpose, package based calculator software solution. It supports working with scalars, complex numbers, vectors, and matricies out of the box. 
This software is used for those who want some help with calculations, and to make life simpler. Most calculators provide rich features, but often lack in others. This seeks to solve that problem.

On top of this rich functionality, it supports packages. These packages allow users to store variables, mathematical functions, and environment constants for later use, and share with others. These packages are XML based, so it is not a hard file to read and decode.
Jason is written in Swift, and is cross platform. Currently development focuses on macOS, but windows and linux editions will be offered at the time of release.

Note that this software is under development, and is being ported from a partially finished, older version, Jason-cli-old. It can be found at [https://github.com/ExclusiveDisjunction/Jason.cli-old]. This software was being written in C++, but for cross platform simplicity, and richer language support, the project has been migrated.

This program is open source via GPL. 

More information will follow as development gets closer to completion!
